Hi there! I make software, as you might have guessed. I mostly do frontend work, but like to be involved in every part of a project that I can.

## Project Highlights

🎙️ [Black Squirrel Entertainment](https://blacksquirrelentertainment.com) - A livestreaming website I made for Kent State University's student media. Has TV and radio livestreams, live updating schedules, and episode archives for TV and podcasts.

🏖️ [Sandbox](https://github.com/darienyoder/new-sand) - A cellular automata that simulates gravity, density, and temperature for up to 200,000 particles on a pixel grid. Rendered using OpenGL. [Blog Post](https://darienyoder.com/falling-sand)

🐲 [Asset Hoarder](https://assethoarder.net) - **(In Progress)** Aggregates public domain assets from a variety of sources to expedite the search of music and images for video editors, game developers, and anyone else who's wasted hours just to find a 2 minute audio track.

⛳ [Minigolf Game](https://github.com/darienyoder/software-engineering-team-beta) - A university project where we made a browser game to practice AGILE software development. I was project manager on a team of 11 developers and managed our Kanban board, burndown chart, and lead our weekly standup meetings. For the game, I created a scripting language to allow my team to very quickly create and iterate upon complex levels designs. [Blog Post](https://darienyoder.com/minigolf)

🧩 [Crossword Builder](https://darienyoder.com/crossword-builder/) - Generates custom crosswords given a list of words. Made to help my grandma make a Scrabble board with all the grandkids' names on it.

🐶 [DestroyDog](https://github.com/darienyoder/destroydog-bookmarklet) - A silly browser bookmarklet that blows up websites.

## Personal

I've also worked on a few [short films](https://darienyoder.com/film), do [sketch comedy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33995737/) in my spare time, and wound up [producing a TV show](https://darienyoder.com/tv-bumpers) for about a year.
